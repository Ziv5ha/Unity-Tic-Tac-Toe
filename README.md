# Unity-Tic-Tac-Toe

this is a Tic Tac Toe game developed as a home assignment in Unity.
## Rules:
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. First player is X, the second is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of his marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

**Currently there's a visual bug this build that removes a visual effect particles.* \
***This bug does not effect the game and exist only in the build. Playing the game through Unity works as expected*
